This repository consists of a data analysis conducted for the wastewater system of the municipality of Heusden. A lack of sensors makes it necesarry to estimate the depth and other variables of certain nodes, as this can identify areas where sensors are most needed.

The preprocessing phase of the research was mainly done in the 'new\_data' notebook. 
The Neural Network analysis was conducted in the GNN folder, all functions are ordered and categorized for easy navigation.
The raw csv data files are kept on my own laptop, as this is sensitive data.
